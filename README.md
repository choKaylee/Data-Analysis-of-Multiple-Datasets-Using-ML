# Data Analysis of Multiple Datasets Using ML   Mar. 2023 – June. 2023
● Cleaned and prepared 11 medium-sized numeric and non-numeric datasets using Python; applied linear 
regression models to find relationships between multiple variables such as significance
● Utilized validation and cross-validation to choose between different machine learning models; applied 
among regression models, decision tree, random forest, and K-NN model for the best performance
● Applied basic statistics and hypothesis testing concepts to measure statistical significance; discussed 
ethical issues in the data analysis process
